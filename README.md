# DSML-Final-submission
# Clothing Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict clothing prices for an e-commerce platform using various machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to build accurate models that can help optimize pricing strategies and improve business decisions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: E-commerce clothing transactions from 2008
- **Records**: 165474 rows of transactions
- **Features**: 14 columns including product attributes, session data, and pricing information
- **Target**: Price (continuous numerical value)

## Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model assuming linear relationships
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Non-linear model with interpretable rules
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble method for improved accuracy
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Distance-based similarity model
5. **Support Vector Regression**: Kernel-based method for complex patterns
